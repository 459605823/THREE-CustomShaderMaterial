## Version 2.4.0

### Changes

- Output variables `newPos`, `newNormal` and `newColor` depricated in favor of `csm_Position`, `csm_Normal` and `csm_DiffuseColor`
  - This is a non breaking change as the old ones still work for compatibility.
- Output variables from custom shader are now optional
  - `csm_Position`, `csm_Normal` and `csm_DiffuseColor` now default to their orignal values (`position`, `objectNormal` and `vColor`) if not set in custom shader.
